GENOME ROOT DIRECTORY
============================================================================
This directory represents the root directory of the genome data.

It hosts both the genome sequence files and the tables that are necessary to 
convert the PWMScan output to BED format.

The genome root directory includes two main sub-directory types:

   /bowtie
   /<assembly> (e.g. /hg19)

The bowtie directory includes the Bowtie index files for each genome assembly.
The assembly directory hosts the chromosome files in FASTA format for a given 
assembly. By convention, we use UCSC assembly names (e.g. hg38, hg19, mm9, etc.).

As an example, we provide the chromosome files of the human genome assembly hg19.
These files are gzipped, to gunzip them, please do the following:

   cd hg19
   gunzip chrom*.seq.gz

The original FASTA files have been downloaded from NCBI at:

   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.13/

The FASTA header has been reformatted to comply to the following so-called 2-pipe rule:

   >chr|NC_000001|NC_000001.10 some text on the genome assembly 

by running the Perl script normHeaders in /hg19.

The relevant part for most PWMScan programs and scripts is the sequence identifier:

   >chr|NC_000001|NC_000001.10
  
which includes the chr string followed by a pipe delimiter, plus the NBI identifier
concatenated with a second pipe, and finally the full chromosome NCBI identifier.

To generate the Bowtie index file for the hg19 genome, you can proceed as follows:

   cd bowtie
   ls -1 -v ../hg19/chrom*.seq | xargs cat > h_sapiens_hg19.fa
   bowtie-build -f h_sapiens_hg19.fa h_sapiens_hg19

It is important to remark that, by convention, the Bowtie index file name starts with
the species name (in lower case letters, e.g.: h_sapiens), followed by an underscore 
and the UCSC assembly name (e.g. hg19).
If one wants to change the naming convention for the Bowtie files, one has to change 
the BOWTIEIDX tables defined in the pwm_scan and pwm_bowtie_wrapper scripts. 

The genome root directory also includes assembly tables that are used to convert the
PWMSCan output to BED format. We provide conversion tables for several common model
organisms such as human, mouse, fruit fly, worm, zebrafish, yeast, arabidopsis, and more.

For each genome assembly, we provide a table for NCBI RefSeq identifier to chromosome 
number conversion (genomes_chr_NC_gi.tar.gz) as well as a table for FASTA sequence 
identifier to chromosome number conversion (genomes_chr_hdr.tar.gz).
The chr_NC_gi files have been downloaded from NCBI whereas the chr_hdr files have been 
locally generated.
These tables are used to convert match lists to BED format. 
In particular, the chr_NC_gi table is used by the conversion program mscan2bed (for matrix_scan)
whereas the chr_hdr table is used by the bowtie2bed program to convert the Bowtie output to BED.

The chr_hdr table can be changed to adapt to other FASTA header format rules.
It is important to remark that the matrix_scan program assumes by default the 2 pipe-delimited
FASTA header format.
This behaviour can be changed via the optional argument -n[--pipes] of matrix_scan.
One can use the -n 0 option, if the FASTA header has no pipe.

To extract the assembly tables, please do the following:

   tar -xvzf genomes_chr_NC_gi.tar.gz
   tar -xvzf genomes_chr_hdr.tar.gz
