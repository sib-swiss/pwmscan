PWM Collections
============================================================================
This directory contains the JASPAR CORE 2018 vertebrates and HOCOMOCO v11 PWM collections.

Each library is provided in three formats: the original MEME library that has been
downloaded from the MEME Suite Web site (http://meme-suite.org/doc/download.html?man_type=web),
and the two formats, integer log-odds and letter-probability respectively, provided by the
PWMScan Web site (http://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmtools/pwmscan.php).

The PWMScan libraries are available at FTP Site: ftp://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmlib.

As an example, to scan the human genome hg19 with the JASPAR CORE 2018 (meme format) and a 
p-value of 10-4 you have to execute the following command:

  time pwmlib_scan -l JASPAR_CORE_2018_vertebrates.meme -g meme -e 0.0001 -d /home/local/db/genome -s hg19 -w -p 2>pwmlib_scan_log.txt & 

On a linux multi-core platform with 48 CPU cores, the whole process takes less than an hour
for scanning the entire human genome with a total of 579 matrices.

pwmlib_scan
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
    pwmlib_scan -l <pwmlib> -e <p-value> -d <genome-root-dir> -s <assembly[hg19|mm9|..]> [options]
    - version 1.1.4
    where options are:
         -g  PWM format [def=logodds]. Accepted formats are : meme, logodds, and lpm
         -f  Scan sequences in forward direction [def=bidirectional]
         -o  Allow for overlapping matches [def=non-overlapping matches]
         -w  Write output to file [def=STDOUT]
         -p  Distribute matrix_scan on multiple CPU-cores [def=non-parallel processing]
         -v  Verbose mode and keep PWM tmp files

    Scan a genome assembly with a PWM collection. Accepeted PWM library formats are the MEME format
    (<meme>), and the MEME-like log-odds and letter-probability formats (<logodds> and <lpm>).
    Description of these formats is provided at http://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmtools/pwmlib.html.

Please report bugs to Giovanna.Ambrosini@epfl.ch

Please note that it is recommended to run pwmlib_scan with the -w (write ouput to file) option instead of
directing the output to STDOUT. With -w, a BEDdetail file is created for each PWM including the sites 
identified by PWMScan.
