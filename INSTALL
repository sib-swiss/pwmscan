Program Installation
============================================================================

For code compilation a suitable Makefile is provided.

- To create the binary files, please type:

make

- To install all the binaries and scripts in $(binDir)=$(PWD)/bin, please type:

make install

- To delete the compiled binary and object files from the current directory, please type:

make clean

- To delete the installed binaries and scripts in $(binDir), please type:

make cleanbin

NB - The $(binDir) variable is by default set to 
     binDir = $(PWD)/bin

     binDir defines the path to all binaries and scripts used by PWMScan.
     Make install changes the bin_dir variable of the installed bash wrapper scripts 
     (pwm_scan, pwmlib_scan, pwm_mscan_wrapper, pwm_bowtie_wrapper, and pwm_convert)
     as well as the matrix_scan_parallel.py python script to point to binDir.  

- To unzip the genome files in $(PWD)/genomedb (the genome root directory) for assembly hg19:

make install-genome


Genome Files
============================================================================

Chromosome files are dowloaded from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes),
and they are named chrom*.seq.
Their header is reformatted in order to comply to the following convention:

>chr|NC_000001|NC_000001.10 some text

The chromosome FASTA files for the human genome assembly hg19 can be found in:

    $(PWD)/genomedb/hg19

Bowtie index files are generated from the chromosome sequence files using the
bowtie-build command.

By convention, the bowtie index file name starts with the species name 
(in lower case letters, e.g.: h_sapiens) followed by an underscore and the 
UCSC assembly name (e.g. hg19).

For more details, please refer to the main README file.


External Software
============================================================================

For Bowtie, refer to the following link:

  - bowtie           http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml

The Bowtie binaries are installed system-wide.


Basic Software requirements
============================================================================

The GNU C compiler collection, UNIX bash (version >=4), Python (version >= 2.7),
Perl (version >=5), and Perl modules Math::Round and Scalar::Util::Numeric (CPAN module).
